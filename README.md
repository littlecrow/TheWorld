# TheWorld
Building a Web App with ASP.NET Core, MVC 6, EF Core, and Angular

##Summary:
- Learn how this .NET core can speed up development for web apps. 
- Learn how to create web pages using ASP.NET MVC
- Build API's with ASP.NET MVC
- Secure pages and API's with ASP.NET MVC
- Use AngularJS for client-side development

p/s: this project is online course I learn from Shawn Wildermuth.

###What is ASP.NET Core?
- It's whole new .NET world out there!
- Have full support to go command-line or IDE
- Open Source top-to-bottom

###HTML and CSS basics
- HTML is the structure of my page
- CSS is the way to render the structure
- Keeping them separate is the right way to do it

###JavaScript
- JavaScripts is a humble, but powerful language
- The default language for client-side web applications
- Bower can simplify the complexity of packages
- jQuery is a powerful ally in build complex pages

###MVC6
- Separate logic and views to enable testability
- Layout can simplify sharing look and feel
- ASP.NET Core supports pluggable configuration

###Bootstrap
- A comprehensive CSS and JavaScript web framework
- You can create navigation panels with Bootstrap
- Bootstrap can further be skinned
- Using bootstrap components create a single look/feel

###Entity Framework Core
- You can lean on Entity Framework for data storage
- Use Migrations to build the database
- Seeding isn't built-in but can do it easily
- Use the repository pattern to create testable data access

###Creating the API
- API and View Controllers are the same in MVC6
- Mapping URIs is simpler at the Controller Level
- You need to know the correct status code to return
- Using REST verbs is how you differentiate actions

###ASP.NET Identity
- Identity can use existing or new EF DbContext object
- Authorize attribuet can support web views or API calls
- Configuration of Identity gives you full control
- Support sharing of user information across app

###AngularJS
- Angular introduces modular way to build rich-clients
- Separates views, models and controllers but on client
- Directives suppport a components-centric model
- Data binding is embedded in views, instead of code

###Angular Routing
- Routing supports client-side switching of views
- Views are simple HTML fragments
- Routing builds on the Controller-View mechanism
- Angular is just JavaScript so most plugins just work

###ASP.NET 5 Deployment
- Preparing app for deployment is important
- Gulp can help simplify deployment preparations
- AngularJS has special requirements for minification
- You can deploy with either VS or the Command Line
